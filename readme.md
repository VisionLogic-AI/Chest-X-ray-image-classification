## About
Pneumonia is a very common disease. It can be either:
    1) Bacterial pneumonia
    2) Viral pneumonia
    3) Mycoplasma pneumonia and
    4) Fungal pneumonia.

This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes. The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. The aim of this task is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data.

In the current problem three types of images has been given - bacterial and viral Pneumonia and the Normal one. The task in this repository I was doing is to make a good classifier which perfectly classify the images into two category - Pneumonia(health diease) which coule be bacterial or viral and Normal.  

## Included:
- python notebook
- saved model
